## Agenda

1.  Models of dynamical systems implemented in R with deSolve
    1.  Exponential decay
    2.  SIR model
    3.  TIME Impact core model
    4.  Demo: implementation of TIME impact core model in tbvax
2.  Assignments:
    1.  complete the assignments so far
    2.  experiment with the tbvax model

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1.1 Exponential Decay

$dy(t)/dt = -k \cdot y(t)$

with $y(t)$ a function of time.

See [expdecay-etc.R](./expdecay-etc.R)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1.2 SIR model

Differential equations:

$dS/dt = −b\cdot c\cdot \frac{I}{N} \cdot S$

$dI/dt = b\cdot c\cdot \frac{I}{N} \cdot S - \frac{I}{d}$

$dR/dt = \frac{I}{d}$

with $N=S+I+R$

and\
$b$: transmission probability per contact\
$c$: contact rate (the number of contacts per unit time)\
$d$: duration of the infectious period

see [SIR_model.R](./SIR_model.R)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1.3 TIME impact model (core model only: no age groups, MDR, treatment history)

![from Tech appendix of BMC Medicine 2016 paper by Houben](SLIN-core.png)

see [TIME-core.R](./TIME-core.R)

use the picture above to define the differential equations in the derivs() function !

experiment with your model

... or peek at the solution: [TIME-core-sol.R](./TIME-core-sol.R)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1.4 Demo: TIME impact model implemented in tbvax

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2.1 Assignment (originally for week 3) [not for the faint of heart :-)]:

Read the paper by Tom Sumner and Richard White in BMC Infectious Diseases: <https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05592-5>

including the appendix: <https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12879-020-05592-5/MediaObjects/12879_2020_5592_MOESM1_ESM.docx>

Implement model 1 in deSolve

Research questions:

-   what is the predicted dynamics (i.e. in what time frame would we see an impact) of the impact of TPT on TB disease incidence?\
-   what is the predicted dynamics of ACF on TB disease incidence?\
-   which intervention would be cheaper (e.g. costs per incident case averted)?
